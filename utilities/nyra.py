"""Reads race data from NYRA's public racing pages (no API, no login).

    current_race(html)  -> the race NYRA is currently counting down to
    racing_on(html, d)  -> whether the track page is counting down to a race on day d
    race_numbers(html)  -> the race numbers on the track page's race tabs (today's card)
    parse_race(html)    -> full detail for one race: post time, distance,
                           surface, and every horse's program number, odds, ML
    odds_live(race)     -> whether betting has opened on a race (odds moved off the morning line)
    race_finished(html) -> whether a race page has dropped its countdown (race official)

How NYRA's pages move through a race (watched live, Belmont races 1-4, Oct 2 2026):
  all day      later races show odds equal to the morning line: betting on a race
               only opens once the race before it is over
  post time    countdown reaches 0 and stays there; nothing marks the start
  ~2 min after the off
               the post time is rewritten to the actual off time (1:43:00 -> 1:45:20).
               Not used: during a delay NYRA also shows passing post times
               (race 3, 2:16 -> 2:31:48), and the board once moved on too early.
  ~5-7 min after the off
               the NEXT race's odds go live (race 4 at ~2:38:30, race 3 off 2:31:48).
               The board moves to the next race here (Joe's call: surest signal).
  ~10 min after the off (official)
               the countdown disappears from the race page; the header moves to
               the next race within about a minute
